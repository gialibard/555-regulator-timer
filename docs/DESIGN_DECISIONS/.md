# Design Decisions - REG.555.V1.0

The hardware architecture of the REG.555.V1.0 was designed with a focus on thermal reliability and manufacturing safety. To ensure the board can handle the LM7805 regulator’s full 1.0A capacity, all power traces were widened to 0.4 mm, providing a safety margin that prevents overheating even under full load. This thermal strategy is supported by a solid copper ground plane on the bottom layer, where I opted for solid pad connections instead of standard thermal reliefs to maximize heat dissipation and minimize electrical resistance.

To reinforce the structural integrity of the circuit, teardrop connections were implemented at the junctions between traces and pads. These smooth transitions significantly strengthen the bond, preventing cracks or pad lifting during manual soldering and improving long-term durability. The layout follows a double-layer routing strategy to maintain a compact footprint, using a clearance constraint between 0.2 mm and 0.25 mm to prevent solder bridging during assembly. Finally, the entire project was validated through Electrical and Design Rule Checks to guarantee that the physical layout perfectly matches the intended schematic.
