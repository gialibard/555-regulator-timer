# REG.555.v1.0 | 555 Timer with Voltage Regulator  

## Overview
This project implements a voltage regulation and timing circuit using the **NE555P** integrated circuit. The system is designed to take a 12V DC input, regulate it to a stable 5V via the **LM7805** linear regulator, and operate in **Astable Mode**. The oscillation frequency is determined by the RC network and can be tuned via onboard potentiometer.

## Objectives
- Implement a modular Schematic/PCB design (Power + Logic).
- Optimize layout for 1A current handling and thermal stability.
- Revisit fundamental concepts of analog electronics and document the main design process.

## Status
- Finalized

## Tools
- KiCad
- NE555 & LM7805
