# REG.555.v1.0 | 555 Timer with Voltage Regulator  

## Overview
This project implements a voltage regulation and timing circuit using the **NE555P** integrated circuit. The system is designed to take a 12V DC input, regulate it to a stable 5V via the **LM7805** linear regulator, and operate in **Astable Mode**. The oscillation frequency is determined by the RC network and can be tuned via onboard potentiometer.

## Objectives
The development focuses on implementing a modular hardware design that integrates power regulation and timing logic. Key priorities include layout optimization for 1A current handling and ensuring thermal stability across the regulation stage. Additionally, the project serves as a technical review of fundamental analog electronics and the formal documentation of the main design process.

## Status
Finalized

## Tools
The hardware was developed using KiCad. The design is centered on the NE555P timer and the LM7805 voltage regulator.
